### Man and Machine

We begin by using advanced 3D design tools on our computer, with a state of the art CNC router, and several other modern power tools. We then incorporate age-old, time-tested techniques for hand carving and finishing each piece... A true melding of old and new, man and machine.

The software we use includes Adobe Illustrator, Fireworks, and Photoshop, as well as Blender and Maya. We use those tools to develop 2 and 3 dimensional artwork that is brought into the CarveWright Designer platform, and in there tweaked and edited to be perfect once carved.

At this point, the digital files are translated into a physical piece through the CarveWright CNC Router. Whether it is a multiple layered sculpture, a simple plaque, or a translucent lithophane, the CarveWright will use the digital files to carve the piece from wood, acrylic, or similar materials.

And while the CarveWright does what few hands could accomplish, it does leave much to be done. We will assemble multiple pieces together with the appropriate joinery, sand and hand carve in places the CarveWright couldn't reach, and finish the piece as desired - be that leaving it 'nude', simply sealing it against the elements, or adding one or more stains or paints.
