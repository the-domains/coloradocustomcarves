### Family Owned, Local Company

While we've moved from Colorado Springs to Denver, _Colorado Custom Carves _remains a small family owned and operated business, dedicated to encourage the growth of local small businesses! As a husband and wife team, we both work together and have a hand in most aspects of the creation of our goods. Primarily, Ken does the digital design and supervises most of the machine and hand carving, and assembly. Likewise, Sylvia mostly focuses on the finish work - sanding, some fine detail carving, and painting or staining.

_While either of us could do it all from start to finish, we love that this not only allows, but encourages us to work together and create such beautiful things with one another!_

By focusing on our individual strengths, we create better products, and faster.
